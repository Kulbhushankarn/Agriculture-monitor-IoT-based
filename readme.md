#Agriculture-monitor-IoT-based

Objectives:
Build an IoT based agriculture monitor
Send useful data from sensors to the cloud
Visualise sensor data graphically

Letâ€™s begin!
The objective here is to create an IoT based agricultural monitor in which the data of the water content of the soil, and the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment in which crops grow, is captured and constantly monitored. This data can then be used to control an irrigation system for the optimal growth of the crop. Pretty cool right!
